The Intriguing
maths in the 500
yr old monument

Even though the ancient monument
had been built in 1591, it
 retains some
of the maths concepts that we still
learn in the 21st century.

It’s structure has bilateral
symmetry as, If we draw an
imaginary vertical line down
the centre of the monument,
we will find that the two
halves are mirror images of
each other.(1) 


Its spiral staircases can show
us an example of helical
geometry. The central pillar
of the staircase acts as the
axis around which the stairs
wind. The steps form the
curve that wraps around this
central axis, creating the
helical pattern.(2)


It enhances it’s aesthetic
appeal by implementing the
golden ratio in its design.
Greek letter phi (φ), is a
mathematical ratio
approximately equal to 1.618
that denotes the value of the
golden ratio.(3)


Its arches are designed in
parabolic geometry. A
parabola is a conic section
formed by the intersection of
a cone with a plane parallel to
one of its sides. When
inverted, this shape creates a
parabolic arch.

Measurements
before the 14th
century


The Char Minar being built in the 14th
century has some immaculate
measurements, sometimes even making
you question the precision that this
monument has shown without the use of
modern tools.

Char minar has a 20m square
base and four identical 56m
minarets, ensuring symmetry.(1)


Minaret height (56m) to total
height (60m) ratio is 14:15.(2)

Base area is 20m x 20m = 400 sq
meters.(3)

Semi-circular arches with a 5m
radius have lengths of π x 5m ≈
15.7m.(4)

Minaret circumference is 2π x 3m
≈ 18.85m.(5)

Arches have 180-degree angles,
minaret tops have acute angles.(6)

Combined volume of base (12,000
cubic meters) and minarets (4 x
1582 cubic meters) is
approximately 18,328 cubic
meters.
